# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

* Function mapping.
* Joins of data streams

## [2.0.0] - 2020-06-08

### Changed
* Improved parameter handling, using [scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt). Not compatible with previous CLI.
* Parallelising over the (local) task slots per task manager is enabled by default.
* Checkpointing is disabled by default.
* Updated Flink from version 1.9.1 to 1.10.0
* Updated Kafka support from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.2
* Updated documentation

### Fixed
* Escape characters were not escaped in generated literals (Internal [issue #81](https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/rml/proc/rml-streamer/issues/81)).
* Curly brackets were not escaped correctly (Internal [issue #65](https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/rml/proc/rml-streamer/-/issues/65)).

## [1.2.3] - 2020-03-16

### Changed
* Updated documentation

### Fixed
* `baseIRI` parameter in `run.sh` was not correctly passed to the RMLStreamer application.
* `socket` parameter only allowed to set the port number, and output was assumed to go to `localhost`. Now you have to set `host:port` as value.

## [1.2.2] - 2020-03-03

### Added

* Option to switch on optimal usage of the task slots assigned to a task manager/job,
at the cost of losing strict output order.

### Changed
* Refactoring of tests.
* Test results are compared with expected output by comparing on RDF level, not String comparison.

### Fixed
* Because generated output is parsed as Turtle during tests, tests generating N-Quads always fail.
* A `@base` directive in the *mapping file* was used as `base IRI` when generating RDF. This is wrong; now the `base IRI`
can be set with the program argument `--baseIRI`.
* An URI with a scheme other than `http` (e.g. `tel`) was not concidered correct.

## [1.2.1] - 2020-01-21

### Added
* Instructions on how to run on Docker.

### Changed
* Bump Flink from version 1.9 to version 1.9.1.
* Bump Kafka support from verison 0.10 to any version supported by Flink's
[universal Kafka connector](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/connectors/kafka.html#kafka-100-connector) (1.0.0+).
* Revised and refactored tests. Now only one Flink / TCP server / Kafka instance will run during test suite.

### Fixed
* Bugfix: when having more than one triples map using the same XML source, things might go wrong.

### Removed
* Kafka 0.10 not supported anymore.


## [1.2.0] - 2019-11-05

### Added
* Support for join between static and streaming data; the "parent" is the static data set, the "child" is the data stream.
* You can name the job (--job-name).
* JSON-LD as output format (--post-process json-ld).
* Option to output every triple coming from one message at once (--post-process bulk).
* Support for Kafka 0.10.

### Changed
* Bump version of Flink from 1.8.0 to 1.9.

### Removed
* Kafka 0.9 or earlier not supported anymore.
* Removed rmls:zookeeper statements from mappings since Kafka 0.10 and higher don't need it.


## [1.1.0] - 2019-05-03

### Changed
* At-least-once delivery of triples.
* Bump Flink from version 1.7.2 to 1.8.0

## [1.0.0] - 2019-03-29

### Added
* Everything! (initial release)
